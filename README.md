Hello 
My name is Morgan i am 17 and I enjoy lots of things such as playing games with my friends I've recently bought a pc so I am able to further both my school work as I am taking a course in computing games and design and I hope to one day be making a game that hundreds of people will play and enjoy like me because I also enjoy gaming.
I can't say I've had tacos on the moon but I have had a really nice bar of chocolate about 10 minutes ago so I guess it kind of competes however I would be willing if hubot were to bring me a moon taco I would definitely try one with them.
